My notes on using terraform and ansible to setup a load-balanced,
static website at digitalocean. All of the details are in 
the 
[blog post](https://chrisstrelioff.ws/sandbox/2025/04/06/terraform_and_ansible_for_loadbalanced_site_at_digitalocean/)
so I will not repeat them here!

Remember, resources at *digitalocean* are NOT free, so proceed with caution!
